Try to use Sentinel II to analyse vegetation in Japan
Some Ideas here
Objectives 
1) use Sentinel-2 to assess vegetation and plant diversity in Japan 
2) Start with the Shikoku island
3) Relate diversity metrics with temple occurrences (the well known 88 temple path - buffers or some shape limit)

Study aim: the role of holy areas as biodiversity hotspot and conservation areas
